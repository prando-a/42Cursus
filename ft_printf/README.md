# ft_printf &nbsp; :sparkles: :sparkles: HACENDADO EDITION :sparkles: :sparkles:

### Description

Extremely simple printf implementation. Faster and more efficient, but bufferless, cut and not ready for error checking (because of its design). Works enough for what is needed at 42School.
This project mainly teaches the use of variadic functions.

* It can only print the following formats: <br>

`%d` | `%i` | `%u` | `%x` | `%X` | `%p` | `%c` | `%s` | `%%`

### Usage

This release uses its own Makefile which will compile function as an `.a` library.
This file can be included to compile any program. Nothing else is needed. <br>

ft_printf is already included on [libft](https://github.com/prando-a/42Cursus/tree/master/libft).
