# ft_printf &nbsp :sparkles: :sparkles: HACENDADO EDITION :sparkles: :sparkles:
Bufferless, cut and not ready for error checking (because of its design), but HEY! It works, at least for what we need at 42 School.

* It can only print the following formats: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `%d` | `%i` | `%u` | `%x` | `%X` | `%p` | `%c` | `%s` | `%%`

Someday I will improve it, but only when needed.
