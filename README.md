# 42Cursus
Where everything started. The chronicles of the progress of a noob turning into sorta decent thing.

## Summary

### [libft + CROM functions](https://github.com/prando-a/42Cursus/tree/master/libft)
My first library, our coding Swiss knife. Most functions are a mess to read, but I'll try to improve them later. Every mandatory + bonus functions are included, memory safe and passed with strict tests of [paco](https://github.com/xicodomingues/francinette). There are some useful extra functions and C99 implementations made with free time, named CROM. <br>
### [ft_printf](https://github.com/prando-a/42Cursus/tree/master/ft_printf)
Simple printf implementation done in the easy way, composed of lotta writes. Funny to do, very easy to understand, useful enough for future Cursus projects.
### [get_next_line](https://github.com/prando-a/42Cursus/tree/master/get_next_line)
Reads a file descriptor and returns a line, mostly used to read files, critically needed to implement fgets when using it with STDIN. Easy to understand, memory safe in basic cases, just a delight to read. :)
### [push_swap](https://github.com/prando-a/42Cursus/tree/master/push_swap)
Allegedly efficient integer sorting program. Radix was used as the main sorting core. Frankly very easy to read and very light source code.
