# Inception

## **Overview**

The Inception project is a deep dive into containerization, orchestration, and the foundational principles of modern DevOps. The project demands the deployment of a multi-service architecture using Docker and Docker Compose, simulating a real-world server environment.

This project emphasizes understanding containerization, service isolation, and how to maintain consistency across multiple environments.

---

## **Objectives**

1. Learn how to use Docker to create isolated containers for services.
2. Build and deploy services using Docker Compose.
3. Understand networking between containers and ports mapping.
4. Implement best practices for containerized deployments.
5. Practice handling environment variables and secure data.

---

## **Project Requirements**

1. **Docker and Docker Compose**:
   - You will set up Docker to orchestrate services using a `docker-compose.yml` file.
   
2. **Multi-Service Architecture**:
   - Create a custom environment with the following services:
     - **Nginx**: A web server for managing and routing requests.
     - **WordPress**: A blogging platform backed by PHP.
     - **MariaDB**: A database server for storing WordPress data.
     - **Adminer** (optional): A database management GUI.

3. **Volumes**:
   - Use Docker volumes to persist data across container lifecycles for MariaDB and WordPress.

4. **Networking**:
   - Configure Docker networking to allow seamless communication between services.

5. **Security**:
   - Ensure SSL encryption is enabled for secure connections.
   - Manage sensitive data using environment variables and `.env` files.

## **Steps to Complete the Project**

1. **Set up Docker**:
   - Install Docker and Docker Compose on your system.
   - Familiarize yourself with the basic Docker CLI commands.

2. **Define `docker-compose.yml`**:
   - Create a `docker-compose.yml` file defining services, networks, and volumes.

3. **Configure Each Service**:
   - **Nginx**:
     - Set up as a reverse proxy for routing traffic to WordPress.
     - Enable HTTPS with SSL certificates.
   - **WordPress**:
     - Deploy WordPress using an official Docker image.
     - Link WordPress to the MariaDB database container.
   - **MariaDB**:
     - Create a MariaDB instance to store WordPress data.
     - Configure a secure root password and database user credentials.
   - **Adminer** (optional):
     - Deploy Adminer to simplify database management.

4. **Use Volumes**:
   - Persist data using Docker volumes:
     - WordPress data directory.
     - MariaDB database files.

5. **Test the Environment**:
   - Validate service interconnectivity and data persistence.
   - Test SSL setup with a browser or curl.

## **Key Learning Outcomes**

- Master the basics of Docker and Docker Compose.
- Understand the importance of isolation and service orchestration.
- Gain practical experience in deploying real-world web applications.
- Learn to secure and manage containerized services.

## **Evaluation Checklist**

1. **Functional Environment**:
   - All services must be running and communicating properly.

2. **Persistent Data**:
   - Data must persist after stopping and restarting containers.

3. **Secure Setup**:
   - SSL must be enabled and functional for Nginx.

4. **Proper Documentation**:
   - Clear instructions for setting up and running the project.

5. **Code Quality**:
   - Adherence to Docker best practices and a clean, organized setup.

## **Conclusion**

The Inception project is a hands-on introduction to containerized deployments. By the end, we have gained the skills to create, deploy, and manage isolated, secure, and scalable environments for web applications using Docker. These concepts form the backbone of modern DevOps and cloud-native development.
