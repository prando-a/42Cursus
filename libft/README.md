# libft + ft_printf + get_next_line + CROM functions
The first student project of 42, a library of many (maybe TOO many) C99 implementations and some really useful string and linked lists managing functions.
Those are exactly 43 functions, bonus included. <br> <br>
Also, aside from what must be done to get the project validated, I made some functions I found a little useful for further Cursus 
projects and other personal stuff.
They started to be done for fun and killing time but they ended to be, as I said, useful in an unexpected moment. They respect the 42 norme and no forbidden functions in use (just malloc and free). <br> <br>
Basically, libft must be completed with the asked functions, but after that, it is highly recommended to incorporate more that 
will be needed later (That's WHY [ft_printf](https://github.com/prando-a/42Cursus/tree/master/ft_printf) and 
[get_next_line](https://github.com/prando-a/42Cursus/tree/master/get_next_line) exist, those that ironically I haven't fused yet with libft when they're indeed more important than CROM functions). <br> <br>
As being my first student project, don't expect to see much skill and readable code, expect the worst possible in fact. I got to rearrange some functions after validating the project, but ft_split for example needs to be redone because it is a complete disaster (BUT IT WORKS!).
Moreover I didn't take much things seriously, such as variable names (char *mander ðŸ™‚).
