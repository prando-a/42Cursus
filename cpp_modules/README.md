# CPP Modules (00 - 09)

The C++ modules at 42School mark a significant turning point for students transitioning from the strict and low-level programming environment of C to the more abstract, flexible, and powerful features of C++. This series of projects is designed to teach Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and delve deeply into the features and concepts that make C++ a robust language.

## From C to C++: The Evolution

### Key Differences for 42 Students
Transitioning from C to C++ at 42 means adapting to new paradigms and rules:
- **Encapsulation and Abstraction**: Unlike C, where data and functions are loosely coupled, C++ emphasizes encapsulating data within classes and exposing functionality through well-defined interfaces.
- **Focus on OOP Principles**: Inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation are the foundations of the modules.
- **Stringent Restrictions Eased**: While C projects prohibit standard libraries beyond `<unistd.h>` and `<stdio.h>`, C++ modules encourage the use of STL containers (like `vector`, `map`, and `stack`) and algorithms, broadening problem-solving approaches.
- **Dynamic Memory and RAII**: Students shift from manual memory management (`malloc`, `free`) to concepts like constructors, destructors, and smart pointers.
- **Advanced Syntax**: Use of operator overloading, templates, and namespaces introduces students to modern programming practices.

The projects encourage mastering these changes while building a strong theoretical and practical foundation in C++.

## Module Summaries

### **CPP Module 00** - Basics of C++
- Introduces the student to the basic syntax and structure of C++.
- Topics covered: `iostream` for input/output, the `std` namespace, basic class definitions, and an introduction to member functions.
- Focus: Grasping the differences between C and C++ basics.

---

### **CPP Module 01** - Memory Management and Operators
- Delves into constructors, destructors, and the concept of the **canonical form** of a class.
- Introduces overloading operators and understanding how dynamic memory works in C++.
- Focus: Memory lifecycle and operator overloading for cleaner code.

---

### **CPP Module 02** - Ad-Hoc Polymorphism and Static Casting
- Explores ad-hoc polymorphism through function overloading and operator overloading.
- Introduces static casts and begins to touch upon the hierarchy of C++ casts.
- Focus: Gaining comfort with polymorphic behavior in C++.

---

### **CPP Module 03** - Inheritance
- Introduces the concept of inheritance and how classes can be extended.
- Topics: Base and derived classes, public, protected, and private inheritance.
- Focus: Understanding reusability and hierarchy in object design.

---

### **CPP Module 04** - Subtype Polymorphism
- Builds on inheritance to introduce polymorphism using virtual functions and dynamic binding.
- Topics: Abstract classes, pure virtual functions, and runtime polymorphism.
- Focus: Understanding abstract behavior and dynamic resolution in C++.

---

### **CPP Module 05** - Exceptions
- Focuses on error handling and the concept of exceptions.
- Topics: `try`, `catch`, and `throw` blocks, understanding how exceptions propagate.
- Focus: Writing robust code that gracefully handles unexpected runtime issues.

---

### **CPP Module 06** - Casting
- Expands on casting techniques with emphasis on:
  - `dynamic_cast`
  - `reinterpret_cast`
  - `const_cast`
- Focus: Understanding the safety and application of different cast types.

---

### **CPP Module 07** - Templates
- Introduces generic programming through templates.
- Topics: Function templates, class templates, and specialization.
- Focus: Creating reusable and efficient code structures.

---

### **CPP Module 08** - Containers and Iterators
- Deep dive into the Standard Template Library (STL).
- Topics: Using containers (`vector`, `stack`, `map`), understanding iterators, and learning about time complexity.
- Focus: Using STL containers effectively and understanding their internal mechanisms.

---

### **CPP Module 09** - Algorithms and Serialization
The final module of the C++ series focuses on complex programming challenges, combining the knowledge from all previous modules:
- **Key Highlights**:
  - **Serialization and Deserialization**: Storing and restoring object states in files or other formats.
  - **Algorithm Implementation**: Students implement custom algorithms and data-handling procedures.
  - **Smart Pointers**: Advanced memory management using modern C++ features (`unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`).
  - **Multithreading**: Introduction to concurrent programming in C++.
  - **Comprehensive Codebase**: Students must apply their C++ knowledge cohesively in a real-world style project.
- Focus: Integrating all concepts from Modules 00-08 and applying them in realistic, challenging scenarios.

## Final Thoughts

The CPP Modules are not just an introduction to C++; they represent a deep dive into modern programming practices. Each module builds upon the previous one, creating a well-rounded understanding of object-oriented programming, memory management, generic programming, and modern software design principles.

Students emerge from these modules not only proficient in C++ but also equipped with the skills to tackle real-world software development challenges.
